# Changes in order from most recent to oldest:

- banned nano now disabled by default, plagiarism separated and enabled by default
- pre-draft updated, even better anti-slop/anti-repetition. this will likely be the new home for anti-slop rather than using banned nano
- Tryhard edits for consistency after recent changes, should work better for more reasoning budgets
- reworded prefill
- edits to writing style prompt

---

- Pre-draft minor update for better pattern tracking
-  Tryhard additions to prevent Claude from getting 'stuck' in the same moment, more progression/forward mobility
-  New/edited anti-slops in `<banned>`
-  Writing style additions
-- I recommend leaving these disabled by default and toggling them per character/scenario. Writing style is prone to becoming stale over time, but a prompt that encourages a specific style for a specific character can be very good. Think of what you want the writing to be like for *that* specific character during *that* specific RP rather than trying to find the perfect prose prompt.
- Fixed Inner Voice XML tags
- Fixed character XML tags
