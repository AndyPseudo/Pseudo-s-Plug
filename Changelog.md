  - I recommend leaving these disabled by default and toggling them per character/scenario. Writing style is prone to becoming stale over time, but a prompt that encourages a specific style for a specific character can be very good. Think of what you want the writing to be like for *that* specific character during *that* specific RP rather than trying to find the perfect prose prompt.
⚫⚪ Fixed Inner Voice XML tags
🔷 Fixed character XML tags
